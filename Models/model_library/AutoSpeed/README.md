## AutoSpeed - closest in-path object detection

For autonomous cruise conrol applications, it is crucial to maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front, known as the closest-in-path object. Detecting the closest-in-path object therefore becomes a very important task for any self-driving or driver assitance application, as it also supports important safety features such as forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking. The AutoSpeed network is a bounding box detection model inspired by the YOLOv11 architecture, in which the backbone c3k2 blocks are substitued by a custom designed 'context' block for improved overall scene understanding.

The AutoSpeed model detects all foreground objects and classifies objects into three categories depending on the object's position with respect to the predicted future driving path of the ego-car:

- objects directly within the future driving path of the ego-car 
- objects cutting-in/cutting-out of the future driving path of the ego-car
- objects outside of the future driving path of the ego-car

### Performance Results

The AutoSpeed network is trained on the [OpenLane](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/OpenLane) dataset on the CIPO detection task. We modify the ground-truth labels by merging 'Level 3' and 'Level 4' category objects in the ground truth dataset into a single class. We use a 90:10 ratio for train:val split, and we achieve a **mAP@50 score of 0.74** and a **mAP score of 0.56** on validation data.

## Model variants
The AutoSpeed network is trained in two variants, the original AutoSpeed network processess frames in square aspect ratio with size 640px by 640px. AutoSpeed 2.0 processess frames in a 2:1 aspect ratio with size 512px by 1024 px, allowing for objects to be detected further away and a wider viewing angle of the scene which is more suited to autonomous driving applications.
